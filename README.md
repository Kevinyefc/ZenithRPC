## ZenithRPC: Promoting Your Work on Discord
ZenithRPC is designed for creators aiming to promote their work on Discord. With a range of interactive features, it offers endless customization possibilities to share your creations globally.

# The right setup guide.
This is the recommended way for you to setup ZenithRPC if you're a beginner please follow this guide!

## First Step: Forking the Guide.
This is pretty simple, but make sure you're going to fork this repository to have the ability of changing the Rich Presence for your own taste.


## Second Step: Changing the Rich presence.
If you're wondering how to change the Rich presence please look at the provided code down below:
```js
const r = new Discord.RichPresence()
      .setApplicationId('Application-ID')
      .setType('PLAYING') // PLAYING, STREAMING, WATCHING, LISTENING, COMPETING 
      .setURL('https://twitch.tv/username')
      .setState('State')
      .setName('Name')
      .setDetails('Details')
      .setStartTimestamp(Date.now())
      .setAssetsLargeImage('https://media.discordapp.net/')
      .setAssetsLargeText('LargeText')
      .setAssetsSmallImage('https://media.discordapp.net/')
      .setAssetsSmallText('SmallText')
      .addButton('Button 1', 'https://link.com/')
      .addButton('Button 2', 'https://link.com/');
    client.user.setActivity(r);
  };
```
Please replace all values to your own. If it seems to say null then you could easily replace it with 'text/image-value'
